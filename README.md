# Gold-Price-Prediction
The "Gold Price Prediction Using Random Forest Regressor" project focuses on forecasting the future prices of gold by leveraging the Random Forest Regressor machine learning algorithm. The project involves gathering historical gold price data along with relevant economic indicators such as interest rates, inflation rates, and currency exchange rates. This data is then preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize scales, and select significant features for the model. The Random Forest Regressor is trained on this dataset to capture complex patterns and relationships. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). By accurately predicting gold prices, the project aims to provide valuable insights for investors and stakeholders in the gold market, enabling more informed and strategic decision-making.
